<hr>

DeepTrace is a deep learning framework comprising five variants of a model whose basic structure includes two or more of the combinations produced by Convolutional block(s), LSTM unit(s) and Dense network(s).

We also introduce a novel training methodology by using future contextual frames. However, these frames are dropped during the testing phase to verify the robustness of DeepTrace in real-world scenarios. 

An optimizer is used to offset the loss incurred due to the non-provision of future contextual frames. The genericness of the framework is tested by evaluating the performance on real-world time series datasets across diverse domains. We conducted substantial experiments that show the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-art methods.
